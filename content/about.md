## Before you go, let me introduce myself...

My name is Alex Nakagawa, and I am a computer science major at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu). More interestingly, I am a [generalist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/07/10/the-secret-power-of-the-generalist-and-how-theyll-rule-the-future/) who loves to work with numbers and be able to make compelling narratives with large amounts of data.

### Aspiring Data Scientist

I used to think that _data science_ was a buzzword thrown around for people to get excited about math. Though it is true that data science involves heavy amounts of numbers, this upcoming field has an immeasurable amount of influence in our daily lives. This realization changed my perspective on the happenings around me, and I haven't looked back since.

Here's what makes data science so interesting: while many scientists seek to find solutions to problems through experimental frameworks, data scientists **find the questions** within the 1 million exabytes of data sprawled all over the internet.

> An exabyte is 1 billion billion bytes, or 10<sup>18</sup> bytes. So assuming Netflix holds [3.14 petabytes](http://gizmodo.com/how-netflix-makes-3-14-petabytes-of-video-feel-like-it-498566450) of data in the cloud, the internet can hold all of Netflix's videos **318,471,338** times over. That's a lot of Netflix.

### Why Start a Blog?

There's a jungle of uncharted territory waiting to be explored in the vast expanse of the cyber world. *(cue Indiana Jones theme)* Like any good explorer, keeping a journal of my findings is essential to disseminating this information to the world.

### Thank you

Out of the [1.3 billion](http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) *(as of January 2018)* websites you could've been reading, you decided to spend some time on mine. From the bottom of my heart, **THANK YOU**. Enjoy!!
