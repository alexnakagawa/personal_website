## Hey there, buddy.

I'm not so sure why you chose to indulge yourself in my random musings and assortment of data analysis, but you can bet I'm happy that you're here. I really want to make it worth your while, so I promise to be interesting. I started this blog as a challenge for myself to write and think creatively every single day. Well, really, it's more of a culmination of things:

1. My mind races with ideas everyday that I forget in an instant. It's like the whole day passes and I'm excited to ruminate in my thoughts, but when I sit down and think about what I did that day - it's all left my mind. To explain the picture above, I figure that my conscience wants to dive deep into my subconscious terrain, only to see that it's disappeared. I don't know - maybe comparing my inability to remember the details of the day to this picture that was taken at the top of Lions Head, South Africa is clich√©, but that's kind of how the days go for me when they get busy at Berkeley. I want to be able to reflect and shape these thoughts while at the same time organize these thoughts in a tangible format.

2. My creativity level fluctuates a ton. With all the stress of school and impending worriedness I'll have trying to figure out my life purpose, I forget to stimulate my right brain often. I've promised myself that I would do so many things this year: start a blog (woo!!), reignite my love for filmmaking, picking up volleyball again. I think this blog can help keep me accountable for completing my goals.

So there you have it. __I am a man of many emotions and experiences but find it difficult to translate these intangibles into words.__

I don't have a direct vision of what I want this blog/website to become, but I'm sure that the answer will come to me sometime throughout this journey. Either way, I'm glad you're along for the ride. If you find that navigating to this website is a little tedious, I will occasionally post my stories on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexnakagawa) as well \**shameless plug\**.
